			Now enter some tags that describe your proposal. Tags are keywords that 
			can be attached to proposals to supply additional informations. Tags are 
			a very helpful instrument to make proposals findable, assignable and 
			classifiable.<br/>
			By choosing significant tags you make it easy for others to find your 
			proposal if they are interested in the same subject.<br/>
			More tags can be added later on.

			After clicking the <code>save</code> button you will be directed to the 
			proposals overview page. You should see your new proposal in the list of 
			proposals. This might take some time.<br/>
			If your proposal doesn't show up right away, wait a little and keep refreshing 
			the page.
