	<h3><a name="whatis"></a>What is a delegation?</h3>
	<p>Delegating means conferring your vote to another person. You can confer your
		vote to someone else for every single proposal but not globally for
		all areas of subject.</p>
	
	<h3><a name="revoke"></a>Can delegations be revoked?</h3>
	<p>Delegations can be revoked at any time to prevent misuse by delegates 
		and to be able to quickly react to a change in the general conditions.</p>
	
	<h3>Are delegations time-limited?</h3>
	<p>No. Delegations remain valid until revoked by either the delegate or the delegating 
		voter.</p>
	
	<h3>Can I vote against the vote of my delegate?</h3>
	<p>Yes, this is possible at any time. In that case the delegation is overridden for 
		this one poll.</p>
	
	<h3>Can proposals be changed after votes have been delegated on them?</h3>
	<p>Yes, proposals may be changed after votes have been delegated on them. This 
		makes it possible for proposals to be developed and refined dynamically and 
		democratically even when many people are involved. 
		Delegations are accounted for when there are polls on changes of a proposal. 
		Before the poll becomes binding the proposal's text is frozen and all delegating voters 
		can revoke their delegation, delegate their vote to another delegate, or vote for 
		themselves.</p>
	
	<h3>How can I delegate my vote?</h3>
	<p>To delegate your vote to another person for a proposal, you can click on the 
		<code>delegate</code>-Button. 
		You can also delegate your vote for specific implementation items within a proposal.</p>
	
	<h3>How do I know whom I can delegate to?</h3>
	<p>Possible delegates are shown on the 'Delegate'-page. These are 
		suggested by the system but you can enter any username in the text field.</p>
	
	<h3>Who can be a delegate?</h3>
	<p>Every member can accumulate votes if others delegate to them.</p>
