	Text editing uses a fairly simple text formatting system known as <i>Markdown</i>. Markdown was 
	invented to allow you to easily apply simple formatting options to your text without the need 
	to know the HTML language. Here are some of the essential options that Markdown provides: 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong><em>Italic text</em></strong>: put single asterisks around your text 
			to produce italic text: <pre>*this is italic*</pre> 
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Bold text</strong>: double asterisks around your text will 
			generate a bold passage: <pre>**I'm a bold snippet**</pre>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Lists</strong> are produced by starting each line with an asterisk or a number. Asterisks 
			will produce bullet points, while numbers will generate a numbered list:
<pre>* This is a list
* Which has bullet items

1. While this list
2. Is numbered</pre>
			Take care to put a single space in front of each list item. If you want to create several levels 
			of lists, increase the number of spaces before each level of the list.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong><a href="#">Hyperlinks</a></strong>: to link to a page, use the following formatting: 
			<pre>[Link title](http://your.link.address.com)</pre>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Images</strong> can be included in a very similar fashion:
			<pre>![Image description](http://image.host.com/picture.png)</pre> 
		</li>
		<li><strong>Headings</strong>: structure your text into sections by using headings. They are produced
		by underlining your text with equals signs or dashes: 
<pre>This is a large heading
=======================

This is a smaller heading
-------------------------</pre>
		
		</li>
	</ul>
