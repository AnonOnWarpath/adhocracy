	<h3>What is Liquid Democracy?</h3>
	<p>Liquid Democracy is a collective term for different approaches to making democracy 
		more liquid, more transparent and more flexible. What all these approaches 
		have in common is the concept of <a href="/static/delegation_faq.en.html">delegating</a> 
		your vote for certain subject areas or subjects. This makes it possible to 
		choose to actively participate in some subject areas and delegate your vote 
		to someone else for others.</p>
	<p>Organisations and informal groups can use Liquid Democracy to collaboratively develop 
		their goals, strategies, internal rules or positions and to make binding decisions 
		about them. Groups and organisations can involve their members in developing 
		solutions to their problems and thus make better decisions. Our web platform implements 
		the two key concepts of Liquid Democracy:</p>
			<center>structured discourse and delegated voting.</center>
	<p>Members of organisations can collaboratively create texts, debate individual paragraphs and 
		vote on the final draft. Each member can at any time delegate their vote to another member 
		or use it themselves.</p>
	<h3>Why Liquid Democracy?</h3>
	<p>Technological progress of the last few years has made global communication a lot easier and 
		faster. These new possibilities have yet to be fully utilized for society. Citizens 
		are involved with organisations, informal groups and networks of all kinds. At the 
		same time, many people feel they are lacking the opportunity to effectively and 
		collaboratively campaign for the issues they are concerned about. This is the problem 
		that Liquid Democracy focuses on.</p>
	<h3>Liquid Democracy in my organisation</h3>
	<p>Communication, exchange of experiences and decision-making in organisations and groups 
		often takes place using inappropriate tools: there are forums, wikis, mailing lists, 
		conference calls and face-to-face meetings. All of these work relatively well in small 
		groups but quickly reach their limits in larger groups - this often leads to a situation 
		where a small minority actually participates or where transparency and clarity 
		dwindle. Tools such as Adhocracy were developed to facilitate broad and democratic 
		involvement of members of large groups.</p>
